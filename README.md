DATA

The data for this analysis came from two sources:

"Statistics on Marriage Registration" from the Immigration Department of the Hong Kong Government. 

https://data.gov.hk/tc-data/dataset/hk-immd-set6-statistics-personal-documentation-marriage-registration


"Statictics on Marriage / Divorce" from the Department of Household Registration of Taiwan 

https://gis.ris.gov.tw/dashboard.html?key=D03#


DESCRIPTION OF DATA

The first dataset is a .csv file which shows the number of marriages in Hong Kong from 2016 to 2020.

The second dataset is a website which shows the number of marriages in all the cities of Taiwan in Republic of Year (Year 2021 = Republic of Year 110)

The data of Taipei from each year (105 to 109 Republic of China era, i.e. 2016 to 2020) was extracted and used to create another .csv file. 

The two datasets were combined and uploaded to Datawrapper to produce a line chart. 


Limitation 
Apple-to-apple comparison was not feasible as Hong Kong and Taipei have different population, pandemic situation and social distancing measures.
